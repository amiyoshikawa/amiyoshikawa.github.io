As a PM Room Assigner at Aulani, my primary responsibility was to review 100-500 pages of reports every night for the following day's arrivals and ensure all guests' requests have been met. Along with reviewing the reports, a typical day would look like this: since our occupany was almost always at a 100%, our phone lines would be ringing nonstop, we would have to listen for Bell, Valet, and Arrival staff to call out arrivals over the radio and we'd have to respond with room statuses, Front Desk Agents would be coming into our office to ask for assistance, and as the first point of contact for all of our guests, we were responsible for providing recovery solutions concerning all lines of businesses. It was a high-stress job which required a lot of patience and poise, but I thrived in that chaotic environment and I loved every moment of it.

In 2018, my team and I were tasked by the Housekeeping and Engineering Department Heads to block off floors so that they could perform deep cleaning and identify and tend to extensive maintenance issues. On surface level, this might sound like a no-brainer, but as a Disney resort located in Hawaii, our inventory was managed by the Walt Disney Travel Company (WDTC) in Calfornia and Florida. Wholesale agents also had limited access to our inventory, so there was always an issue of being overbooked when we didn't have the inventory to account for it. Seeing negative numbers in our inventory was an hourly occurence, but due to our team not having full control of our own inventory, it required lots of planning and constant monitoring to ensure guests were never impacted by this. During the project, we'd also have to account for some rooms requiring more attention than others, so there was a lot to be mindful of. 

In the end, we were successfully able to complete the project without ever inconveniencing a guest's arrival experience. This project required effective teamwork and communication, and everyone had to pull their own weight. Although I'm not a huge fan of multitasking, the job required it, so this particular project helped me to prioritize tasks in the order of importance so that I'd be able to execute them in a timely manner.
