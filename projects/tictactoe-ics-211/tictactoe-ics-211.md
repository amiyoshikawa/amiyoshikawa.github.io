For ICS 211, we were given the task to make a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allowed the user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. As this was my very first game, I was incredibly excited for the assignment. 

There are several issues with my code. To name a few, I failed to find a way to get the computer's turn to generate on its own. As a result, the game does not function the way that it's intended to. The idea is for the user to select a tile. Then, the computer should automatically generate its own mark on a random tile that has yet to be played. The code, as it stands, requires that the user select tiles for both themselves and for the comptuer. Now, where's the fun in that? 

Another issue I ran into was the fact that the same tile can be selected an unlimited amount of times, and every time the tile is selected, the mark (X or O) changes. Ideally, once a tile is selected, clicking on it again shouldn't change the mark. 

Although there are still many issues with the code, I learned a lot from this assignment. It made me realize that I lacked the ability to identify what each line of code actually does. Also, I learned the importance of writing little sections of code at a time and testing it along the way, so that when an issue arises, it would be easier to identify than having to go through lines of code. I think that was (and still is) something I need to work on. It also showed that I need to practice writing clearer and concise code.
