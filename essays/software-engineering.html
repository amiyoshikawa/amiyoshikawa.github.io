  <h2 id="its-not-always-a-linear-journey">It’s Not Always a Linear Journey</h2>

<p>During my first attempt at college, I was studying to become a high school English teacher. English was my favorite subject, but I was mostly inspired by my middle school and high school teachers in Hawaii who served as mentors and a beacon of light when I was dealing with the most traumatizing events of my life. I knew I wanted to be in a position where I could help people just as my teachers had helped me when I was weak and vulnerable. However, upon completion of my A.A. degree, I realized that my heart wasn’t in it anymore, and opted to take a break from school to figure out what it was that I truly wanted to do with my life. I knew I still wanted to help people, but I just didn’t know how.</p>

<h2 id="quarter-life-crisis-a-look-into-my-past-and-change-of-plans">Quarter-Life Crisis, A Look Into My Past, and Change of Plans</h2>

<p>In the meantime, I worked several random jobs just to get by, until I stumbled into the hospitality industry. Fortunately, I was given many opportunities for advancement and quickly worked my way up from the bottom. I was happy with my salary, and my seniority gave me a great work-life balance. I thoroughly enjoyed my work, but a part of me always wondered what my life would look like if I decided to go back to school to pursue a bachelor’s degree in a field that I was genuinely interested in. I was beginning to feel stagnant, and I had no interest in continuing up the proverbial corporate ladder. I took on opportunities to work in management for a couple of hotels, but none of those roles resonated with me.</p>

<p>A part of me was always intrigued by the world of Software Engineering. Video games play a big role in the Japanese culture, so naturally, it was a part of my upbringing as a kid living in Tokyo. Despite being raised in a household that was struggling financially, I always had my hands on the latest and greatest game consoles. I was fascinated by the work and detail that went into technological advances. I also have fond memories of coming home from school and messing around with profile themes and formatting for a blog site called Xanga and a social networking service called Myspace. Little did I know that I was experimenting around with HTML and CSS!</p>

<p>For years, I wanted to take the leap to become a Software Engineer, but feelings of incompetence stood in the way. I struggled with Math and Science all through primary and secondary school, and I’m still haunted and wounded by the memories of my classmates and teachers in Japan telling me that I wasn’t smart enough. I knew that if I decided to pursue this degree, to say that it would be challenging would be an understatement. I’d be met with great resistance, so I kept putting this grand dream aside.</p>

<p>Then, as if it were a sign from the universe, COVID happened, and I was furloughed from my job for a year and a half. I knew this was my chance to make big changes in my life. I was never a straight-A student and I’m far from being what I would consider a prime candidate for this field of study. But after a ten-year hiatus, during Fall of 2021, I enrolled back in school to pursue my lifelong dream. I was back at square one. I gave up my career and got back to working random jobs, but this time, to accommodate my school schedule. Here I am today, desperately trying to defy the odds as a 30-something year old switching into a career path that is notoriously ageist. The pressure is definitely on, and I feel completely out of my element studying among these brilliant, young minds. Here’s to proving all the nay-sayers (mostly myself) wrong.</p>

<h2 id="cant-stop-wont-stop-even-if-all-the-signs-tell-me-otherwise">Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, Even if All the Signs Tell Me Otherwise</h2>
<p>Up to this point of my academic career, I have learned Java, C, and C++, but I know I’m not close to being proficient in these programming languages. As we tackle JavaScript in ICS 314, I fear that I won’t be able to keep up with the pace. I often find myself questioning my decision to return to school, and I have reservations about continuing with something I know I’m not good at, but the deep desire to grow and learn is still there. I know I don’t have an apptitude for coding, but I want to believe that I could get to a good level of proficiency, even if it means I’ll have to work twice as hard.</p>

<p>By the end of this semester, I hope to have gained a better understanding of the concepts that I currently struggle with. I believe that would aid in boosting my confidence. My coding ability requires a lot more work, and quite frankly, most of the big programming assignments I worked on don’t function as they were supposed to. I intend to make a strong effort to overcome the mental barriers and complete projects that I would be proud to showcase. Another one of my goals for this class is to gain enough knowledge and skillset to begin to develop an application to replace an inefficient software for my current job. Technology can be scary, but in the right hands, it is a multifaceted tool that can empower us to do wonderful things. Although my career path has changed several times along the way, at the root of it, I still want to help people. I want to do great things and do my part to contribute to this world.</p>
