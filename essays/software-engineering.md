## It’s Not Always a Linear Journey

During my first attempt at the college experience, I was studying to become a high school English teacher. I was inspired by my middle school and high school teachers who served as mentors and role models during a chaotic period in my life. I knew I wanted to be in a position where I could help people. Upon completion of my A.A. degree, I realized that my heart wasn’t in it anymore, and opted to take a break from school to figure out what it was that I truly wanted to do with my life. 

## Quarter-Life Crisis, A Look Into My Past, and Change of Plans

In the meantime, I worked several random jobs just to get by, until I stumbled into the hospitality industry. I was fortunate enough to have been able to quickly work my way up from the bottom and make a decent living. I was truly passionate about the work I did, but there was always that voice in the back of my head that kept wondering what my life would look like if I decided to go back to school to pursue a bachelor’s degree in a field that I was genuinely interested in. I was beginning to feel stagnant, and I had no interest in continuing up the proverbial corporate ladder. I took on opportunities to work in management for several hotels, but none of them resonated with me. 

A part of me was always intrigued by the world of Computer Science. Video games play a big role in the Japanese culture, so naturally, it was a part of my upbringing as a kid living in Tokyo. Despite being raised in a household that was struggling financially, I always had my hands on the latest and greatest game consoles. I was fascinated by the work and detail that went into technological advances. 

I desperately wanted to be a part of the Computer Science world, but feelings of incompetence stood in the way. As someone who struggled greatly in Math and Science all through primary and secondary school, I was often told by my teachers that I wasn’t smart enough. I knew that if I had decided to pursue this degree, it would be far from the path of least resistance. So naturally, I kept putting this grand dream aside. Then, as if it were a sign from the universe, COVID happened, and I was placed on furlough for a year and a half. I knew this was my chance to make big changes in my life. Sure, I was never a straight-A student and I’m far from being what I would consider a prime candidate for this field of study. But here I am today among young, brilliant minds, trying to defy the odds and prove all the nay-sayers (mostly myself) wrong. 

## Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, Even if All Signs Tell Me Otherwise
Up to this point of my academic career, I have learned Java, C, and C++, but I know I’m not even close to being proficient in these programming languages. As we tackle JavaScript in ICS 314, I fear that I won’t be able to keep up with the pace. I often find myself questioning my decision to return to school, and I have reservations about continuing with something I know I’m not good at, but the deep desire to grow and learn is still there. I know I don’t have the talent for coding, but I want to believe that I could get to a good level of proficiency, even if it means I’ll have to work twice as hard. 

By the end of this semester, I hope to have gained a better understanding of the concepts that I currently struggle with. I believe that would aid in boosting my confidence. The ultimate goal is to come out of this class and have the knowledge and skillset to develop an application for my current job. Technology can be scary, but in the right hands, it is a multifaceted tool that can empower us and do wonderful things. Although my career path has changed several times along the way, at the root of it, I still want to help people. I want to do great things and do my part to contribute to this world.
