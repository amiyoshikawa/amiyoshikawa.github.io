## First Impressions

During the winter of 2020, nearly a year into being furloughed from my job due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I made the impulsive decision to enroll in an online, introductory coding workshop for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Prior to taking this workshop, I had no experience in programming, so this was all very new and exciting. The three-week course taught me the very basics of these markup and programming languages, and by the end of it, I knew I wanted to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I ended my career in the hospitality industry in June of 2021, and by Fall, I was ready to embark on an academic journey as a Computer Science major.

## A Rude Awakening

Fast forward three years since my first exposure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I forgot most of what I learned in that introductory workshop. I immediately gravitated towards the online JavaScript courses offered through Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp. Although I spent hours pushing through the lessons, by the end of it, I still felt very intimidated and overwhelmed by the concepts that I still didn’t fully understand. One thing was for certain; I needed to drop that negative inner dialogue because it was doing more harm than good. I’ve always been very hard on myself, and since programming doesn’t come naturally to me, there’s an added pressure that goes into this whole process of learning. All I know is that repetition is the key to getting better. 

## A Different Approach to Software Engineering

When I was first introduced to the concept of athletic software engineering, I did not know what to expect. I had previously taken ICS 111, 211 and 212 at Leeward Community College, and we were tasked with lengthy programming assignments where nothing was timed. After completing my first practice Workout of the Day (WOD) for ICS 314, I realized how this could easily identify my strengths and weaknesses. It affirmed that I had a lot of brushing up to do and I’ve got a long road ahead of me. It also made me realize the importance of having a strong foundation. My hope for this class is to dedicate more time into honing my skill, and with practice, I will slowly gain more confidence in my ability to write efficient and concise code. You cannot change without adversity!
